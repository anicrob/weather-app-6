# Weather App 
Use this weather app to search for any major city's weather in the United States. It will display today's weather along with a 5-day forecast. See the Instructions on how to use this call app.

## Instructions
There are two ways to search for a city:
1. The first way is to type in a city in the search bar and click on Search. Once this is completed, after you refresh, a button of the last 5 searches will appear under the search button.
2. If you want to search a previously searched city, and it was within the last 5 searches, click on the button with the name of the city you want to see the weather for, and it will search that city's weather!
